                    I'm Breanna Gushman, currently navigating my sophomore year at UMass Amherst. My journey took an unexpected turn when I found myself grappling with moments of sadness. In those challenging times, I realized that what I truly needed was change. That realization sparked the birth of Body Butterfly. I took it upon myself to explore ways to not just lift my spirits but also to undergo a profound transformationâ€”both mentally and physically. Body Butterfly became my canvas for self-discovery and improvement. It's a reflection of my resilience and the creative solutions I found to bring positive change into my life. I hope it serves as an inspiration for others on their own paths of personal growth and transformation.
